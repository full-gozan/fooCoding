# Lesson 3: Hands-on SQL

Objective: This class will be a walk-trough of the homework for this week,
and a presentation of next weeks homework. A small hands-on session will be held.

## Topics to be covered

### Entity Relationship Diagrams
    - Associative entities from many-to-many relationships
    - Boolean attribute instead of a table

### Exercises
Weâ€™re going to play around with an example-database originally created for Oracle, the HR schema.  
Clone or download the HR-schema from github,

We're going to look at examples of selects, inner, left and right joins appropriately.
There might be the need for a subselect as well...
