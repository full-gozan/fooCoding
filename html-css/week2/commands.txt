1) create a hidden file and how to display it using ls command

    -touch test.txt
    -ls -a

2) create multiple nested directories with one mkdir command
    -mkdir -p these/folders/are/just/for/fun
    -cd these/folders/are/just/for/fun

3) Verify number of characters in the file.
    -echo "test" > fun
    -echo "another test" >> fun
    -wc -c fun

4) append new character to the begining of the file 
   -cat fun
   -> fun 
   -cat fun 
   -echo "test" > fun 
   -echo -e " third one $(cat fun)" > fun
